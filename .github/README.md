# [In Search for Yaeohi](https://game.trifect.show)
**(Trifect Series)**

A __2.5D adventure game__ that takes a snapshot into **4,051 years ago** ***from the*** ***year 2038***.

__"Viridus"__, known today as *The
Chihuahuan Desert*,  starting to live up to its current name, *now becoming* arid and dry after the death of A BYGONE EVIL that *had previously* given the land its sprawl of life.

The AZURIAN people that inhabited the region were responsible for the _EXTINCTION_ of species and these lasting effects are still felt by the world, *standing to reason why* history goes unrecounted in time's heedless march.

Play together as ***Primrose, Moxhi, and Laggas,*** each possessing abilities to afflict upon this age-old wound that's __been unable to bleed.__

> ***The question remains with you.***
> "Will you consume nature, or grant nature's eternal wish to grow past maturity, and leave you behind?"
